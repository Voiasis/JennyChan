This is some Discord bot I made to help me learn Java. Not very useful yet..


What it can do so far:
- Reply to mention
- List commands
- Show bot uptime 
- Server info
- Show users avatar
- Add reaction to message
- Say command
- Reply to messages
- Edit messages the bot has sent
- Delete messages
- Send text to choosen users DMs
- Give roles
- Remove roles
- Kick members with optional reason


Ideas for future:
- Finish ping command
- Check user perms with moderation commands
- Ban with optional time and/or reason
- All commands work with bot mention
- Music
- Interaction commands
- Auto open threads in #suggetions for my server
