This is some Discord bot I made to help me learn Java. Not very useful yet.

What it can do so far:
- Reply to mention
- List commands
- Show bot uptime 
- Say command
- Edit messages the bot has sent
- Delete messages
- Send text to choosen users DMs
- Give roles
- Remove roles
- Kick members with optional reason

More to come.
