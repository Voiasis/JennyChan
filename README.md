This is some Discord bot I made to help me learn Java. Not very useful yet..


What it can do so far:
- List commands using a button page system
- Play/skip music (wip)
- Show bot uptime 
- Show bots ping
- Server info (wip)
- Userinfo command
- Mute users with optional reason (times them out, doesnt use cringy roles)
- Checks permissions before using moderation commands
- Show a users avatar
- Add reaction to a message
- Say command
- Reply to messages
- Edit messages the bot has sent
- Delete messages
- Add emojis from emoji or image URL
- Send text to choosen users DMs
- Give roles
- Remove roles
- Kick members with optional reason
- Ban with optional reason
- Lock & unlock channels
- Set channel slowmode
- Auto opens threads in #suggetions (for my server)


Ideas for future:
- Add temp ban
- All commands work with bot mention
- Interaction commands
